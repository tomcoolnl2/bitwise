# Bitwise operations in C

## Introduction

- 8 bit = 1 byte = size of a char
- Bing able to operate on a bitlevel, especially to be able to integrateEmbedded sytems or micro controllers
- Programming languages tends to be byte oriented, whereas hardware tends to bit oriented (through assembly, machine language)
- C can manipulate 16-bits (or 2 bytes) in a word, aswell as a Byte (8 bits) in memory
- This makes C a medium to low levelk language

- [ ] Bitwise Operators:
  - [ ] Logical Bitwise
    - [ ] AND _&_: Binary; Needs 2 integer typed operands
    - [ ] OR _|_: (Inclusive OR) Binary; Needs 2 integer typed operands
    - [ ] XOR _&_ (Exclusive OR): Binary; Needs 2 integer typed operands
    - [ ] NOT _~_ (One's complement): Unary; Needs 1 operands
- [ ] Shift Operators

  - [ ] Left Shift _<<_
  - [ ] Right Shift _>>_

- Bit operators are used to manipulate the bits of signed/unsigned primitive types

  - [ ] `int`
  - [ ] `long`
  - [ ] `char`
  - [ ] `short`

- Binary is Base 2 numbering system (represents a power of 2)
- Base 60 is used in Circle degrees, and secs in trigonometry, and in secs, mins in time.
- Decimal is Base 10 (represents a power of 10)
- Base 16 = Hexidecimal (Assembly)
- Base 8 = Octal (OCT)

- Bit Masking with AND &
